 * Final Project "Snake Game" Part 1 - Snake Class
 * 
 * Class Description:
 * The Snake class gives the "Snake" movement. Handles logic of snake. Snake is represented by a LinkedList
 * that is manipulated throughout game. Implements FindPoint interface to handle a contains method.
 * 
 * Game Description:
 * In a snake game the objective is to navigate a snake through a walled space (or maze), 
 * consuming food along the way. The user must avoid colliding with walls or the snakeâ€™s ever-growing body. 
 * The length of the snake increases each time food is consumed, so the difficulty of avoiding a collision
 * increases as the game progresses.
