 * Final Project "Snake Game" Part 2 - Point Class
 * 
 * Class Description: The Point class allows the entire game and its
 * objects to be referenced by (x,y). Also gives direction to snake
 * during movements (North,South,East,West). Use (0,0) to be top-left
 * corner.
 * 
 * Game Description: In a snake game the objective is to navigate a
 * snake through a walled space (or maze), consuming food along the
 * way. The user must avoid colliding with walls or the snakeâ€™s
 * ever-growing body. The length of the snake increases each time food
 * is consumed, so the difficulty of avoiding a collision increases as
 * the game progresses.
