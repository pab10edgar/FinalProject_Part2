 * Final Project "Snake Game" Part 2 - Direction Enum
 * 
 * Class Description: Direction enum that creates hard coded values for
 * directional movement by snake. Uses NORTH(0, -1), SOUTH(0, 1),
 * EAST(1, 0), WEST(-1, 0), NO_DIRECTION(0,0);
 * 
 * Game Description: In a snake game the objective is to navigate a
 * snake through a walled space (or maze), consuming food along the
 * way. The user must avoid colliding with walls or the snakeâ€™s
 * ever-growing body. The length of the snake increases each time food
 * is consumed, so the difficulty of avoiding a collision increases as
 * the game progresses.
