 * Final Project "Snake Game" Part 1 - Wall Class
 * 
 * Class Description: The Wall class creates boundaries within game
 * that "kill" snake. Use starting and ending values, and (0,0) as top
 * left corner for reference
 * 
 * Game Description: In a snake game the objective is to navigate a
 * snake through a walled space (or maze), consuming food along the
 * way. The user must avoid colliding with walls or the snakeâ€™s
 * ever-growing body. The length of the snake increases each time food
 * is consumed, so the difficulty of avoiding a collision increases as
 * the game progresses.
